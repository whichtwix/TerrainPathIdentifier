## TerrainPathIdentifier
this is my c# implementation for [this project idea](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2016/franke-mountain-paths). Essentially turning a grid of integers into a grayscale map and being able to draw paths on top. 
The bulk of the code has been adapted for both a console app and a .net maui blazor app, though the latter can not be distributed and a person has to run it themselves.

## An example of the blazor maui

## Data
A ready made file is [here](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2016/franke-mountain-paths/dataFiles/Colorado_844x480.dat) - 480 x 844. I havent managed to find anywhere else where other files could be made/found to use with the app, so if anyone knows, let me know!
